## 📌 Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 1 –  Weave AI magic with Groq**

## 🎯 Objective
AI Code Helper solves the challenge of developer productivity by providing a multi-modal AI assistant that helps programmers solve coding problems, analyze code, translate between programming languages, and receive architectural recommendations - all in one streamlined application. It serves developers of all experience levels, from beginners struggling with error messages to experienced teams seeking architectural guidance.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

**Team Name:**
`Prototype`

**Team Members:**
* Lakshya Tripathi (GitHub: @lakshyatripathi / LinkedIn: lakshya-tripathi / Team Lead)
* Pushkar Gupta(GitHub: @pushkargupta75 / )


**Our Approach:**
* We chose this problem because developers spend 30% of their time debugging issues rather than building features
* Key challenges addressed include integrating multiple input modalities and creating an AI system that understands code context across languages
* Our breakthrough moment came when we successfully implemented real-time code analysis with suggestions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Core Technologies Used:**
* Frontend: Streamlit, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: Python, FastAPI
* Database: SQLite
* APIs: Groq API, Google Speech API
* Hosting: AWS EC2

**Sponsor Technologies Used:**
* ✅ **Groq:** Used Groq's AI models (Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3 70B, Claude 3 Haiku) for fast inference and code analysis
* ❌ **Monad:** Not implemented
* ❌ **Fluvio:** Not implemented
* ❌ **Base:** Not implemented
* ❌ **Screenpipe:** Not implemented
* ❌ **Stellar:** Not implemented

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ **Multi-Modal Input**: Text, image, and voice inputs for maximum flexibility
* ✅ **Code Execution**: Run and test Python code snippets directly within the app
* ✅ **Code Translation**: Convert code between different programming languages
* ✅ **Architecture Advisor**: Get AI-powered recommendations for project structure
* ✅ **Error Analysis**: Upload screenshots of error messages for instant fixes

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.7+
* Git
* Groq API Key

**Local Setup:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codecatalysts/ai-code-helper.git
cd ai-code-helper

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file with your API key
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env

# Start the application
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧬 Future Scope
* 📈 **Team Collaboration**: Add multi-user collaboration features for team coding sessions
* 🛡️ **Security Analysis**: Implement code security scanning and vulnerability detection
* 🌐 **IDE Integrations**: Create plugins for VSCode, IntelliJ, and other popular IDEs
* 🤖 **Custom Model Training**: Allow teams to fine-tune the AI on their codebase
* 📱 **Mobile App**: Develop a companion mobile application for on-the-go assistance

## 📎 Resources / Credits
* [Groq](https://groq.com/) for providing the AI models
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web app framework
* [Google Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) for voice recognition
* All contributors and users of this tool

## 🏁 Final Words
Our hackathon journey was filled with intense coding sessions and late-night breakthroughs! The biggest challenge was integrating the voice recognition with code understanding, but seeing it work for the first time was magical. We learned so much about AI model deployment and prompt engineering, and we're excited to continue developing this tool. Special thanks to the mentors who guided us through the API integration challenges!
