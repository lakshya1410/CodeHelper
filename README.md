## Overview

AI Code Helper is a powerful Streamlit application that leverages Groq's AI models to assist developers with various coding tasks through multiple input methods. This tool helps programmers solve coding problems, analyze code, translate between programming languages, and receive architectural recommendations for their projects.

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Input**:
  - üí¨ **Text Input**: Ask coding questions or paste code for analysis
  - üñºÔ∏è **Image Analysis**: Upload screenshots of code or error messages for visual recognition
  - üé§ **Voice Input**: Ask questions using voice commands

- **Code Tools**:
  - ‚ö° **Code Execution**: Run and test Python code snippets directly within the app
  - üîÑ **Code Translation**: Convert code between different programming languages
  - üèõÔ∏è **Architecture Advisor**: Get AI-powered recommendations for project architecture

## Installation
